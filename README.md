# JokeTeller.github.io

Project created to test some JS features and API.

Jokes are all about developers, and once the user press the button "Tell me a joke" a random joke will be picked from a quite big list of 3000 jokes.

The dancing robot is a .SVG picture, which adds a bit of fun in the background.

Jokes' source: sv443.net (They offer free to use and open source applications and services)

The chosen API aims to skip sexist and racist jokes.

This project has purely been created with the sake of exploring API and JS features with no intention to make fun of anyone.
